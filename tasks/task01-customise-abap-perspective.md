📘 ABAP Learning Journey – Progress Log
🔹 Task 1: Open and Customize the ABAP Development Tools
🧩 Business Example:

As an SAP customer programmer, my task is to customize the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) perspective by:

Adding "ABAP Function Module" to the New menu,

Saving the custom perspective as S4D100_XX (where XX is my user number),

Removing and then reinstating the Help menu and Launch toolbar.

✅ Steps Completed
1. Open the Debug Perspective
Navigation: Window → Perspective → Open Perspective → Debug

✅ Opened successfully.

2. Save the ABAP Perspective as S4D100_XX
Navigation: Window → Perspective → Save Perspective As...

Entered name: S4D100_01 (replace with your actual number)

✅ Saved successfully.

3. Add ABAP Function Module to the "New" Menu
Navigation: Window → Perspective → Customize Perspective...

Tab: Menu Visibility

Path: Expand File → Expand New

✅ Checked ABAP Function Module

Result: ABAP Function Module now appears in File > New

4. Remove and Reinstate Help Menu + Launch Toolbar
Remove: In Customize Perspective, unchecked Help and Launch Toolbar

✅ Confirmed removal

Reinstate: Went back and re-checked both

✅ Confirmed they appeared again in the interface

📝 Notes:
Perspectives can be customized to match specific workflows (e.g., debugging, development).

Editors in ADT are context-sensitive: different editors are triggered based on object type.

These small UI customizations make repetitive tasks more efficient for ABAP developers.
